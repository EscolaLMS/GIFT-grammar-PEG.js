GIFT grammar for PEG.js

---

Why?

- GIFT is a very portable and rich format for questions in Moodle. 
- GIFT is not user-friendly to write, but if there was a validator/editor before you upload to Moodle, the process would be better.
- PEG.js is a grammar that allows rapid development thanks to sites like https://pegjs.org/online
