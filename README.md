# GIFT-grammar-PEG.js
Development of PEG grammar to parse [GIFT (quiz question) file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIFT_(file_format)). The goal is to find an intuitive and fun way to create quiz questions.

Initial hacking done using https://pegjs.org/online

The grammar.txt file goes on the left and the test input.txt goes on the right (intuitive?) 

## GIFT format (from Moodle.org)

This table is not sufficient to understand everything. Please see https://docs.moodle.org/en/GIFT_format for many more details.

## Class model for Moodle questions (quiz) format

The following UML diagram is an interpretation of the XML format for Moodle quiz import/export (the XML format is naive and can't easily be schema-tized). This interpretation aims to facilitate the understanding of the content and relations. It's a hybrid domain and data model.
